This can lead to stones falling out in the future.<br\/><br\/>- Clean carefully using warm water, a drop of dish soap and a soft brush. Rinse with cold water after a few minutes. Do not immerse opals, bright blue moonstones or rubies.<br\/><br\/>Your gold pieces also need special care. Because gold is a soft and relatively delicate metal, be careful when cleaning and storing your gold jewelry. To clean your gold jewelry, use a mixture of some warm water and a few drops of mild soap. Gently brush your jewelry in this mixture, then rinse and dry with a soft cloth. When storing your gold jewellery, store it in a place where it does not rub against each other or scratch, in their own case if possible or in a jewelery box. Try to keep your gold jewelry away from perfumes, cosmetics and chemicals.<\/p>"}}},"block_order":["text_AnWpbB"],"settings":{"desktop_content_position":"center","content_alignment":"center","color_scheme":"background-1","full_width":true,"padding_top":40,"padding_bottom":52}}},"order":["image_banner_zMzcNU","main","multirow_mxwHGi","custom_richtext_NqKUKF","rich_text_7cdjBj"]}
